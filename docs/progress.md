# Progress

What works today, and what does not. Updated at the end of every phase.

The brief this is built against is large — thirteen phases, seventy-odd node types, a semantic diff
engine, a graph canvas, scheduling, CI integration, a private runner agent. Rather than build all of
it thinly, each phase ends with something that genuinely runs and is tested, so any point on this
list is a working product rather than a skeleton.

The measure of done is the twenty-step scenario in §21 of the brief: create a project, define two
environments, capture baselines from several IDs, ignore the dynamic fields by clicking them, run it
again, review the diff, accept part and reject part, build a multi-step workflow on a canvas, run it
across both environments, and trigger the same suite from CI — without writing a line of code.

## Phase A — Foundation · **done**

| | |
|---|---|
| Solution | Seven projects with the layering enforced by `ArchitectureTests` |
| Database | EF Core 10, SQLite and PostgreSQL, separate migration sets, both generated |
| Tenancy | Global query filter per workspace, with an explicit system scope for background work |
| Identity | Cookie sign-in, sign-up creates the first workspace, capability-based authorization |
| Languages | Persian and English, RTL and LTR, one JSON catalogue, completeness tested |
| Theme | Light, dark and system, applied before first paint |
| Interface | Design tokens, app shell, command palette, dashboard, projects, activity log |
| Tests | 57 passing — architecture, tenancy, provider compatibility, roles, slugs, navigation, HTTP smoke |

**Verified by running it.** The application starts on SQLite, migrates, seeds a demo workspace, signs
in, and renders every page in both languages, both themes and three widths. 84 screenshots were
reviewed; two defects found and fixed (a four-tile summary row breaking into 3+1, and Latin
punctuation landing on the wrong end of a line inside Persian cards).

**One real bug caught in the process.** SQLite refuses to `ORDER BY` a `DateTimeOffset`, and every
list in the application is ordered by a timestamp — so the development and test provider failed on
sign-in, the dashboard, the project list and the activity log. Fixed systemically with a value
conversion to fixed-width UTC text rather than per query, and `ProviderCompatibilityTests` now runs
the real queries against SQLite.

### Not built yet, and knowingly so

- The dashboard's pass rate, failing count and run trend read zero because nothing has run yet.
  They show `—` rather than `0`, because "no failures" and "nothing has run" are different claims.
- A project page has no tabs. Environments, scenarios, baselines and runs arrive in the phases that
  create them; eleven tabs leading nowhere would be worse than the honest empty state that is there.
- `ProofFlow.Worker` starts, connects and idles. It has nothing to run until Phase F.
- No Docker image yet. Note that this machine has no Docker daemon, so when one is written it can
  only be verified in CI — that will be said plainly rather than implied.

## Phase B — Environments, secrets, request builder · next

Environments with base URL, authentication, headers, proxy and allowed hosts. Encrypted secrets.
The HTTP executor with its SSRF guard. A request builder and a response viewer you can click a
field in. A fake API to test against, so the demo runs with no internet.
